# Personal portfolio based on WhatATheme
From the original repo
**WhatATheme** is a customizable Jekyll Portfolio theme which supports blogging. You can use this theme in order to create an elegant, fully responsive portfolio.

#### You can checkout the [**Demo Here**](https://thedevslot.github.io/WhatATheme/) :boom:

I have personalized the portfolio replacing blogs with projects, but keeping the same structure.
