### Who am I
I am a multi-faceted engineer with broad experience in a variety of sustainability related projects, combined with software development skill from product management to software development

I am a passionate professional with a talent for taking innovative ideas and taking them from concept to launch 

I think the engineering mindset and experience gives me the focused approach towards solving problems. Coding is my tool of choice and I love doing it. Although I am not a professional, I am a quite advanced self-thought programmer and this allows me to empathize with the development team, and I am as comfortable speaking with them as I am liaising with executives.

### My past

I started as a mechanical engineer focusing on mechanical design and building physics. The latter has become my real passion and allowed to me to really understand how buildings work at a very deep level. Moving in the Middle East I started to focus also on microclimate. A complex combination of solar radiation, temperature and wind. Not finding a proper tool or clear definition, I started to build my own. I have always loved programming, especially when applied to engineering problems. 

The very first version of what it is now the Microclimate Comfort Tool won the Middle East Green Building Research Award in 2005. Galvanized by the success I decided to take a sabbatical to travel, improve my programming skill and develop a proper tool for real users. In 2020 my co-founder and I set up [Virtual Climate Ltd](https://www.virtual-climate.com/) to manage and promote the software.

The transition to product management was incidental but probably inevitable. I love solving complex problems via technology, and we really live in a golden age of software.

Currently, I am Chief Product Manager at IES Ltd where I focus on digital twins and the integration of the numerous software tools IES is developing. Digital twins live between the real and the digital world and probably represent the synthesis of my passions: engineering, computer modelling and software.

I am a passionate individual who seeks purpose in his work. For me the fight against climate change is a moral imperative and working in Climate Tech allows me to make an impact.

### Future
My dream is to build a digital twin of the built environment. I have been trying to do it for last 7 years of my career, but I have come to realize that only an organization with large resource will ever be able to make it a reality.

Imagine a World Wide Web for the built environment. Linked, privacy aware, digital twins across cities and countries. I believe that digital twins are the solution to climate change in real estate. Data would be collected, organized and enriched based on standard ontologies and accessible via APIs. A digital twin from a single building to cities to countries. 

I am keen to continue with product management primarily in the field of climate tech because climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time and I want to be a part of the solution.

I bring passion, competence and curiosity to the table, combined with deep understanding of technology, keen empathy with users and business sensitivity. I have good product intuition from the commercial and technical side. Â 

As a relentless learner, I am always abreast of the technology and competition. I work closely with other product teams in a way that aligns goals and expectations with the company vision.

I have strong bias towards action and prototyping. The engineering mindset and experience gives me a focused approach towards solving problems. I am an experienced self-thought programmer and I can empathize and communicate quite easily with dev teams.
