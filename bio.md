### Who am I
I am a multi-faceted engineer with broad experience in a variety of sustainability related projects, combined with software development skill from product management to software development

I am a passionate professional with a talent for taking innovative ideas and taking them from concept to launch 

I think the engineering mindset and experience gives me the focused approach towards solving problems. Coding is my tool of choice and I love doing it. Although I am not a professional, I am a quite advanced self-thought programmer and this allows me to empathize with the development team and I am as comfortable speaking with them as I am lieasing with the senior management.

### My past

I started as a mechanical engineer focusing on mechanical design and building physics. The latter has become my real passion and allowed to me to really understand how buildings work at a very deep level. Moving in the Middle East I have started to focus also on microclimate. A complex combination of solar radiation, temperature and wind. Not finding a proper tool or clear definition for that matter, I started to build my own. I have always loved programming, especially when applied to engineering problems. 

The very first version of what it is now the Microclimate Comfort Tool won the Middle East Green Building Research Award in 2005. Galvanised by the success I decided to take a sabbatical to travel, improve my programming skill and develop a proper tool for real users. I finally set up a company to maange the tool.

The transition to product management was incidental but probably inevitable. I love solving complex problems via technology and we really live in a golden age of software.

The products I helping to create are being informed by years of being an end user and developer focused on not only the technical solution but also the needs and experiences of users. 

In my current position I have also discovered for the Internet of Things and the confluence between the real and the virtual in the form of digital twins. 

They probably represent the synthesic of my passions: engineering, computer modelling and software.

I am a passionate individual and I am looking for a work with purpose. For me the fight against climate change is a moral imperative and that is why I want to work in Climate Tech to make an impact. I want to be able to say: I did my part.

### Future
My dream is to build a digital twin of the built environment. I have been trying to do it for last 7 years of my career, but I have come to realise that only an organisation with large resource will ever be able to make it a reality.

Imagine a world wide web for the built environment. Linked information across several data sources, public and private, with different level of access, easily accessible and all linked via standard ontologies.

I believe such a digital twin is the only way to tackle climate change for the built environment. Data would be collected from any available data source, organised and enriched based on standard ontologies and accessible via APIs. Engineers could look at data from one single building while governments could access aggregated data from neighbourhoods to countries. 

This digital twin would be alive. Every entity in the twin would be geolocated and time stamped. It would allow to make long term prediction to actually give meaning to policies such decarbonisation by 2050 or X% reduction by 2030.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I am keen to continue with product management primarily in the field of climate tech because climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time and I want to be a part of the solution.

What I think I bring to the table is a multi-faceted engineer with deep understanding of technology at every level, keen empathy with user and business understanding.

I believe Ihave strong product intuition and I know how to balance the creative, practical, and analytical.Â 

I am always abreast of the technology and competition. A continuos learner

I work closely and collaboratively with other product domains in a way that aligns goals and expectations with the company vision.

Soft influence

I have a clear bias towards action and strongly believe that a prototype, even a basic one, is "worth a thousand words".
