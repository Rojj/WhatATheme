The Nottingham Trent Basin is a residential development with high aspirations. The architects and the university designed together with two goals in mind. First they wanted to show off all the sustainbility features of the development and then they wanted to study the behiour of the residets. To achive the first goal they installed a 3.2m x 1.8m touch wall with which the resodents  and visitor can interact. they also instellaed several Iot sensors in the homes so they can study the bahaviour. Everything of course in respect of privay.

Project Manager and engineering technical lead - Digital twin for a new development in Nottingham. IES created an interactive platform that enables the Trent Basin community to visualise its energy data in real-time. There are different level of access for the public - all the specific uilding data is hidden and only aggregate information is diplayed, and a dedicated link for the reseacrhecr. It was a great project as it shouws how even for a relatively small developmnet there are so many issues with data that need to be resolbed.
