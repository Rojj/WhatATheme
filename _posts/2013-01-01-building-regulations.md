The project, lead by the International Finance Corporaton ([IFC](https://www.ifc.org/)), had the goal of supporting developing countries in the creation of new building regulations. Previously, building regulations for developing countries, usually characterized by warmer and more humid climates, were based on international or US based existing standards that were applied without considering the specificity of the climate and the technological and political environment.

With this series of project the IFC wanted to develop more rigorous criteria to establish regulations based on computer simulations of typical building with the typical characteristics of the local buildings, actual weather data and taking into account any specific technological constranint. For example, high efficiency chillers were not easily available in Bangladesh.

The first part of the project was to perform a parametric analysis to predict the dependance of key metrics such the Energy Use INtensity on the key buidilg paarmeetrs

After several consultation with local stakeholders, architects, engineers, governmanet officials, a process was put in place to rigorously select the most impactful criteria to reduce the energy consumption not of specific buildings, but of the real estate sector as a whole. Once again these criteria were based on local specificity such constrnction methodologies, availabe technology ad most importantly climate
