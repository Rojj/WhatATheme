In a place like Dubai outdoor spaces are not usable during the Summer months. Temperatures and humidity are far too high and there is far too much sun. During peak summer there are not many options. Shading is needed, but still the high temperature is a problem. However, during the "shoulder" seasons there are options. Shading is still needed of course, but additional strategies can be put in place. For example:
* promote ventilation by correctly designing the urban layout
* change specific surface materials so that they radiate less heat (we have all experience the fresh sensation in a church)
*  adopt localized mechanical cooling with evaporative coolers.

But how do you measure the effectiveness of these interventions? How can you assess the impact for a typical year? How do you measure the complex interaction of all the environmental factors on the human body?

To answer these questions I started to develop my own tool. Find out more at [Virtual Climate]({% post_url 2020-01-01-virtual-climate %})
