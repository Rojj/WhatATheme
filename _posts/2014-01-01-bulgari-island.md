In a place like dubai the summer months are really not livable outdoor. The temperatues and humidity are too high and there far too much sun. During peak summer there is not much you can do. You need shade, but still the temperatuers are far too high. But during the shoulder season there are options. you can add shadding of course, but you can also promote ventilation, you cna change the specific surfaces material so that they radiate less heat (we have all experience the fresh sensation in a chrch for example) or you can also adopt localised mechnical cooling wioth evaporative cooling.

But how do you measure the effectivness of these intervnation? And how can you asses this for a typical year? How do you measure the complex interaction of all the environmental factor on the human body and for one typical year. To answer these questions I started to develop my own tool.
