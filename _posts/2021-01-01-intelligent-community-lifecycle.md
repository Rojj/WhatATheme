The [Intelligent Communities Lifecycle](https://iesve.com/icl) is the Digital Twin offering from IES Ltd. IES Ltd is best known for the flagship product IES [Virtual Environment](https://iesve.com/software/virtual-environment) used by thousands of engineers around the world to improve the energy performance of buildings.

In my current position of Chief Product Manager I have contributed to the birth and development of the company Digital Twin offering. Informed by years of industry experience and software development I focus on the technical solution and users' experience. I have always been passionate about computer modelling and with the recent explosion of the Internet of Things and the construction industry embracing digital twins, I have just found my sweet spot.
