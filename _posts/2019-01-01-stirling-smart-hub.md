Stirling had the vision of a centralised platform where they could collect all their data so they could cehck the perforacne of the their real estate asssts. They also wanted to be sure that the renewbales installation were perdng as expected. The problem they had was that even for this realtively samll sample (30 schools in the piot) they had 7 differerent data sources. For example data from utilities was in CSV format and received by email, the buildinmanagement system was not really accessible from outside the buildings, etc.

the first steo on the problejct was to create an independaent adat layers. Connectors were created with ech data source, the data was notmalised and finally uploaded on our time series atabase.

Dashboards were craeted to show all the information in one single pane of glass. These dashbords, with only relevant information presented at the right time, were quite appreciated and were further developed in other 3 projects. They have actually became the main component of a completely new product clled the Command Cnetre
